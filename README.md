# BridgePatternExample
A simple C# project which demonstrates a trivial example of the bridge pattern

## "Incorrect" (no bridge pattern) Example, with guest appearance from the Red Square:

![No bridge pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joeppie/BridgePatternExample/master/wrong.svg?sanitize=true)



## A beter example (But still a bit lame.)

![Bridge pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joeppie/BridgePatternExample/master/correct.svg?sanitize=true)

A *good* example should of course have an 'implementation' that consists of more than a single property :)
